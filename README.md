For our project we have decided to create a mock Casino where you can participate in various casino games in order to try to win big with crypto. These would give users the chance to bet their cryptocurrency and if lucky, win more back. 

The overall goal of this system is to cater to a population of people who may not have that much of an interest in crypto but want to start somewhere. By having them participate in a low stakes environment this will allow people to become comfortable using crypto in a way that might seem more familiar to them. 
	
We will use JavaScript to implement a web-based casino that will feature all casino games for users to participate in. We also plan on using JavaScript to code the
games that will be available to the users.
