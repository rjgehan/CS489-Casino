Project Proposal
	For our project we have decided to create a mock Casino where you can participate in various casino games and betting environments in order to try to win 
  big with crypto.  Some examples of our casino games include Blackjack, Slots, and Roulette.  Along with casino games, there would also be a place to participate
  in sports betting.  These would give users the chance to bet their cryptocurrency and if lucky, win more back. The overall goal of this system is to cater to a 
  population of people who may not have that much of an interest in crypto but want to start somewhere. By having them participate in a low stakes environment this
  will allow people to become comfortable using crypto in a way that might seem more familiar to them. 
	Due to laws regarding online gambling, sports betting, and the minimum age to gamble, our crypto casino will only be available for crypto owners who meet the 
  guidelines.  They must be 21+ and live in a state where it is legal to gamble online and participate in sports betting.
Use Cases may include browsing or participating in card games, sports betting, and casino games. Users can play Blackjack, Slots, and Roulette. Users will be able 
to withdraw earnings or winnings from casino games to their wallet. 
We will use JavaScript to implement a web-based casino that will feature all casino games for users to participate in. We also plan on using JavaScript to code the
games that will be available to the users. Ideally we would be able to create a form of security where users have their IP checked and verified so that the casino 
is in accordance with state laws.
