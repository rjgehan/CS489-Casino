This Branch has all of the final code organized. This is one of four branches, main has all of the original code fomr the begining of the semester, master has updated code from us sending it back and forth, and the pages branch has the code for the github pages tha we wanted to let the class go to but navigating to the other pages turned out to be too dificult and time consuming
