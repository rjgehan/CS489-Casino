This Branch has all of the final code organized. This is one of four branches, main has all of the original code from the beginning of the semester, master has updated code from us sending it back and forth, and the pages branch has the code for the github pages that we wanted to let the class go to but navigating to the other pages turned out to be too difficult and time consuming
